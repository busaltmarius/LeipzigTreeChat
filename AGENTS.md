## Commit style

ALWAYS follow these instructions when doing a commit or being asked to commit the code!

Inspect current changes with `git diff` at the start of committing.

Follow https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ strictly.
Always plan how many and which commits to make before actually committing.
Try to do small atomic commits.
ALWAYS ask the user to approve the commit plan!
